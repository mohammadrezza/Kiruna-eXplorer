TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================


## PROCESS MEASURES


### Macro statistics


- Number of stories committed vs done
  - 1/1
- Total points committed vs done
  - 3/3
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
  - 95.5/97.3

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed



### Detailed statistics


| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  | 27      | -      | 82      | 83.8        |
| #19    | 6       | 3      | 13.5          | 13.5           |


- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
  
 average estimate: 2.89 h

 average actual: 2.34 h

 standard deviation estimate: 2.83 h

 standard deviation actual: 2.12 h
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1
  res: -0.02

## ASSESSMENT


- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The primary error in our estimation was related to the task of document addition. Firstly, the process of inserting the areas took longer than anticipated. Secondly, a significant number of documents were added in an unexpected moment, which was not accounted for in the initial plan. As a result, the time spent on this task was effectively doubled.


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Positive: following documentation is beneficial
  - Negative: To be more productive, we should have had more interchangeable roles, which might have given us the opportunity to complete an additional story.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

We achieved all the goals:
to improve quality and reliability, fix the bugs,  apply the stakeholders feedbacks, and to read and follow the documentation.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

Considering the quality improvement goal, We definitely improved quality by focusing heavily on SonarCloud. However, we had to sacrifice the planned hours for fixing old tests due to the unexpected workload caused by the addition of original documents.
  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

As a team, we achieved our planned goals while successfully staying attentive to and incorporating the stakeholders' requests throughout the process.
